                    Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks;
                </p>
                <p>
                    researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently adapt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results.
